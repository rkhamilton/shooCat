shooCat
=======

This project uses a PIR motion sensor to trigger a vibration motor and buzzer to scare cats off of my counter.

This second revision of the shooCat project uses an ATtiny85 microcontroller chip on a custom PCB. The typical power draw during non-alarming conditions is about 50 uA at 4.5 V (uses three AAA batteries with no voltage regulator).
